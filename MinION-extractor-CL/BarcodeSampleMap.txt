# Version 1.0

# I recommend creating a new Barcode Sample Map file for each MinION run.  
# The format for this file is as follows (Without the # character):
# BARCODENAME SAMPLEID
# One barcode per line, with a single space between them. 
# You can use ROOT to set a sample ID for the reads directly under the input directory. 
# Don't use spaces or punctuation in your sample IDs, I'll try to clean em up but operating systems don't like those.
# Capitalization matters.
